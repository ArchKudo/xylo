  abstract = {Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most frequent form of human genetic variation. They are of fundamental importance for a variety of applications including medical diagnostic and drug design. They also provide the highest\textendash resolution genomic fingerprint for tracking disease genes. This paper is devoted to algorithmic problems related to computational SNPs validation based on genome assembly of diploid organisms. In diploid genomes, there are two copies of each chromosome. A description of the SNPs sequence information from one of the two chromosomes is called SNPs haplotype. The basic problem addressed here is the Haplotyping, i.e., given a set of SNPs prospects inferred from the assembly alignment of a genomic region of a chromosome, find the maximally consistent pair of SNPs haplotypes by removing data ``errors'' related to DNA sequencing errors, repeats, and paralogous recruitment. In this paper, we introduce several versions of the problem from a computational point of view. We show that the general SNPs Haplotyping Problem is NP\textendash hard for mate\textendash pairs assembly data, and design polynomial time algorithms for fragment assembly data. We give a network\textendash flow based polynomial algorithm for the Minimum Fragment Removal Problem, and we show that the Minimum SNPs Removal problem amounts to finding the largest independent set in a weakly triangulated graph.},

  abstract = {Metagenomics is the study of genetic material recovered directly from environmental or clinical samples by a method called sequencing. The broad field may also be referred to as environmental genomics, ecogenomics, community genomics or microbiomics. While traditional microbiology and microbial genome sequencing and genomics rely upon cultivated clonal cultures, early environmental gene sequencing cloned specific genes (often the 16S rRNA gene) to produce a profile of diversity in a natural sample. Such work revealed that the vast majority of microbial biodiversity had been missed by cultivation-based methods.Because of its ability to reveal the previously hidden diversity of microscopic life, metagenomics offers a powerful lens for viewing the microbial world that has the potential to revolutionize understanding of the entire living world. As the price of DNA sequencing continues to fall, metagenomics now allows microbial ecology to be investigated at a much greater scale and detail than before. Recent studies use either "shotgun" or PCR directed sequencing to get largely unbiased samples of all genes from all the members of the sampled communities.},

  abstract = {Metagenomics is a discipline that enables the genomic study of uncultured microorganisms. Faster, cheaper sequencing technologies and the ability to sequence uncultured microbes sampled directly from their habitats are expanding and transforming our view of the microbial world. Distilling meaningful information from the millions of new genomic sequences presents a serious challenge to bioinformaticians. In cultured microbes, the genomic data come from a single clone, making sequence assembly and annotation tractable. In metagenomics, the data come from heterogeneous microbial communities, sometimes containing more than 10,000 species, with the sequence data being noisy and partial. From sampling, to assembly, to gene calling and function prediction, bioinformatics faces new demands in interpreting voluminous, noisy, and often partial sequence data. Although metagenomics is a relative newcomer to science, the past few years have seen an explosion in computational methods applied to metagenomic-based research. It is therefore not within the scope of this article to provide an exhaustive review. Rather, we provide here a concise yet comprehensive introduction to the current computational requirements presented by metagenomics, and review the recent progress made. We also note whether there is software that implements any of the methods presented here, and briefly review its utility. Nevertheless, it would be useful if readers of this article would avail themselves of the comment section provided by this journal, and relate their own experiences. Finally, the last section of this article provides a few representative studies illustrating different facets of recent scientific discoveries made using metagenomics.},

  abstract = {Xylitol is a natural five-carbon sugar alcohol with potential for use in food and pharmaceutical industries owing to its insulin-independent metabolic regulation, tooth rehardening, anti-carcinogenic, and anti-inflammatory, as well as osteoporosis and ear infections preventing activities. Chemical and biosynthetic routes using D-xylose, glucose, or biomass hydrolysate as raw materials can produce xylitol. Among these methods, microbial production of xylitol has received significant attention due to its wide substrate availability, easy to operate, and eco-friendly nature, in contrast with high-energy consuming and environmental-polluting chemical method. Though great advances have been made in recent years for the biosynthesis of xylitol from xylose, glucose, and biomass hydrolysate, and the yield and productivity of xylitol are substantially improved by metabolic engineering and optimizing key metabolic pathway parameters, it is still far away from industrial-scale biosynthesis of xylitol. In contrary, the chemical synthesis of xylitol from xylose remains the dominant route. Economic and highly efficient xylitol biosynthetic strategies from an abundantly available raw material (i.e., glucose) by engineered microorganisms are on the hard way to forwarding. However, synthetic biology appears as a novel and promising approach to develop a super yeast strain for industrial production of xylitol from glucose. After a brief overview of chemical-based xylitol production, we critically analyzed and comprehensively summarized the major metabolic strategies used for the enhanced biosynthesis of xylitol in this review. Towards the end, the study is wrapped up with current challenges, concluding remarks, and future prospects for designing an industrial yeast strain for xylitol biosynthesis from glucose.},
